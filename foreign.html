    <h2>Foreign Policy</h2>
    <p>The United States is a symbol of freedom and opportunity in a world often plagued by chaos and oppression. U.S. foreign policy should aim to increase the nation's influence for good and lift the oppressed of the earth, where possible. I don't advocate for America as the world's police force. However, I do support America as a partner in the global economy, working for the good of all the world's citizens, not just those fortunate enough to be born on our soil.</p>
    <h3>Immigration</h3>
    <p>Many immigration platforms are founded in fear--fear of job loss, fear of crime, and ultimately, fear of the unknown. However, these fear-based reactions are not founded in fact. <a href="http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-criminol-032317-092026">A thorough review of scholarly data suggests no correlation between immigration status and crime</a>, though falsehoods about immigrants as likely criminals are frequently perpetuated by immigration's opponents.</p>
    <p>My view of immigration suggests a balanced approach between compassion for those who desire to live the American dream and the economic reality that America cannot handle an infinite in-flow of new immigration. I propose removing the restriction that requires that immigrants from any foreign nation cannot exceed one quarter of all immigrants annually. This restriction fails to account for population of the country of origin and serves little purpose to benefit us or those who seek to immigrate here.</p>
