    <h2>Domestic Policy</h2>
    <p>The government exists to serve its citizens--to support them, to protect them, and to perform services deemed by the people to be in their interest. The government should be empowered to do what the people want it to do, while allowing individuals the freedom to govern their own lives, and the pursuit of their own happiness. The government also  has a responsibility to balance services rendered with responsible fiscal policy. The government also has a core responsibility to regulate negative externalities and guide free markets toward net positive outcomes where free markets alone will not allow for those outcomes.</p>
    <h3>Healthcare</h3>
    <p>Inequity in healthcare access should be of concern to any compassionate American citizen. Our healthcare system is fundamentally broken, with skyrocketing costs doing little to ensure outcomes. Promises of innovative technology driving down costs and improving quality remain largely unfulfilled, despite billions of dollars of both public and private investment. Universal access to preventive and routine care is a critical first step in changing healthcare from a system which incentivizes illness to one which rewards sustained health. While rising premiums are a critical concern for all Americans, a continued emphasis on this preventive care and spreading risk across both sick and healthy populations is critical to long-term sustainability. The individual mandate, while unpopular, is vital to the success of long-term healthcare reform, and should be reinstated while other policy efforts continue to evolve.</p>
    <p>We also need to encourage more Americans to own their own health. While many health challenges are attributable to genetics and seem to strike indiscriminately, other critical illnesses can be largely explained by poor health decisions. We need to take action to encourage healthy eating and consistent physical activity, especially among the rising generation. These changes often need to begin in the home, rather than as a result of government intervention. However, there are steps that can be taken to improve America's overall health and wellness, and decrease the strain on a floundering healthcare system.</p>
